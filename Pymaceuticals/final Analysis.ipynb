    "02) We have done the above summary table based on tumor volume on each drug regimen. Less tumor volume means the drug has worked better. Therefore, lowest mean, median, variance, standard deviation and SEM shows the most effective ones against cancer. So, we can come to a conclusion: Drug Capomulin and Ramicane are the most effective ones from these 9 drugs.\n",

    "03) According to the correlation and regression chart, it clearly tells us that there is a direct connection between Mouse weight and tumor volume. Tumor volume is highly increased when weight increases.\n",
